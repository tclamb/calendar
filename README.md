# calendar

A quick and derivative console calendar written in Clojure,  
Inspired by Eric Niebler's CppCon 2015 talk, ["Ranges for the Standard Library"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFUXNMfaciE),  
Which was inspired by the D Programming Language community wiki's page, _[Component programming with ranges](http://wiki.dlang.org/Component_programming_with_ranges#Case_Study:_Formatting_a_Calendar)_.
